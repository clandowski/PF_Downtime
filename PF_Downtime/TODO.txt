Add an Export to Excel function so that organizations can be sent to others more easily without everyone needing this program
 - https://epplus.codeplex.com/ may work, I haven't worked with exporting excel sheets before.  Could spit out a CSV, but that seems messy.
 Format should be simple.  Tab 1 is summary info, Tab 2 is Rooms, Tab 3 is Teams

 Refactor Resources to be a list rather than hardcoded values of an object.  The Cost/Earn modifiers would need a small amount of work.
 Make an OrgResource object that stores a base resource, a cost, and an income.  Each OrgObject and Org_Augmentation would have a resource list
 Any advantages to (Resource, Cost, Income) vs (Resource, Amount) and having both a cost list and income list?
 Would then be able to simplify and cut down code for getting totals, having them pass a parameter to choose the resource instead of having a hard method for each.

 Hide Augmentations box on the OrgTeam screen?

 Change from longs to 32 bit integers?

 Refactor code in ObjectDisplay, it works but is messy for adding objects to the list, mostly because of index onchange events
 Should disable those for the duration of that code block, do everything as needed, and re-enable

 Review concerns for Org objects, do the methods make sense there to do their calculations, or should they be externalized?
